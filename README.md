# Create-Your-Own-Probability-Distribution
Language Model Text Generation Lab This project explores the fundamental principles of language models by implementing probability-based text generation. Using a sampling approach, the lab demonstrates how language models assign probability distributions to candidate words and generate coherent text continuations.
